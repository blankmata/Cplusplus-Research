Please read attached Word document that details the research purpose behind using C++.
A brief overview is as follow:
1. The purpose of the assignment was to learn a new language and do basic computations such as finding the mean, mode, median, etc..
2. The program reads in from a input file containing 100,000 numbers and print out the above results into an output file.
3. This is my first introduction to C++.
